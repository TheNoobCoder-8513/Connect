Connect is a GUI phonebook app, made for linux Opearting systems, which can be used to store details about your contacts seamlessly.

The project is still at beginning stage.
It is a part of my learning journey of popular UI library for C GUI development, GTK.

Connect uses GTK-4 library and other normal pre-installed C header files as dependency.
You could install gtk4 ackage from your OS's repective package manager.
The data is stored in text files being present inside "data" folder. It uses pointers and changes data on-the-go.
